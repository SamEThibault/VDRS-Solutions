# Duncan:

Dev Branch: DS_77_79_Booking_Functionality

Progress: Completed the Back-End Unit Tests for the Booking Functionality. Completed the Front-End new pages and necessary changes to satisfy the Booking requirements.

Difficulties: Had some difficulty testing the Booking functionality, particularly ensuring there are no bookings being created with overlapping dates. After some discussion with
Sam, together we were able to work through the difficulty.

Plan: I plan to stay proactive on the upcoming Pull Requests and to stay available in case while testing the Front-End, Vasuki finds any bugs I may have created.

# Rahul:

Dev Branch: No Branch Yet

Progress: Have been waiting for the backend functionality to be complete before testing SQL Injection.

Difficulties: No Difficulties at the moment.

Plan: Get started on Injection tests for the create_booking method.

# Vasuki:

Dev Branch: vasuki-a6

Progress: Working on building the frontend tests (3 types: I/O partitioning, Boundary testing)

Difficulties: No Difficulties at the moment.

Plan: Complete the frontend tests and create PR.

# Sam:

Dev Branch: 76-be-booking-functionality

Progress: Merged the create_booking() method and created elementary tests
to ensure all requirements are met. I reviewed Duncan's PR and suggested
some logical changes for the tests/method.

Difficulties: Issues with testing before I noticed I was not committing
my database modifications in the method.

Plan: Keep reviewing PRs, plan another mid-week meeting next week, and
update the Docker image once everything is merged.
